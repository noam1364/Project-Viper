# Project-Viper
A very basic python interpreter, built in c++.
The interpreter is capble of basic operations such as variable assignment, type checking
of existing variables (including lists), addition and subtraction of integers (not of variables),
deleting variables and length cheking of lists.

I created this project for the sole purpose of practicing c++,
and it is in a very early stage and is a work in progress. 
I stopped working on it due to a lack of time.
This is my first C++ project and I wrote is a long time ago.
I have a lot of ideas on how to expand, improve
and simplify the project and the code itself, including
implementing turing machines and automatons to simplify the pharsing procces.
